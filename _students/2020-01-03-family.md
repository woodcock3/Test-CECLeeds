# Part of the family
At City, students are part of the church family.

**Student, 20's and 30's Weekend Away** – At the end of January we have our annual weekend away. This is a great
chance not only to build great friendships with the other students at City, but also with the wider church
family.

**Serving** – From Crèche, Explorers, City Kids and Ignite, to Student Teas and Coffees and the worship team, at City
we’ve been blessed with students serving in different church ministries and we’re always looking for more
people to get stuck in!
