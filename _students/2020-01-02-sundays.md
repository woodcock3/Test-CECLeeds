# SUNDAYS

Student Minibus – Don’t let our location put you off! We run a minibus service for our students who can’t
make it to church another way. We’re hoping to continue this this year with social distancing in place.
Student Lunches – We’re not sure how this will look this year, however, in a non-COVID world, following our
Sunday morning service our students head for lunch with another family in church to enjoy some good food
and fellowship.
Student Seminars – Student seminars happen a couple of times a term and are a great opportunity to chat
through what God’s Word has to say on a particular topic – past seminars have covered topics including
devotions, finances, relationships, rest and more.
