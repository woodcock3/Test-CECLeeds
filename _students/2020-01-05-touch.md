# Contact us
Thinking of joining City this year? Get in touch! We’d love to welcome you, answer your questions, and give
you a bit of insight into what it’s like to be a student at City.
Just drop a line to the office email (see the ‘Contact Us’ page of our website) and we’ll get back in touch.

You can also get in touch by sending us an email. Over the next few weeks we’ll be announcing further plans and events, so follow us on Instagram or Facebook to keep in the loop.
