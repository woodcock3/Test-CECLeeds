# In Leeds for university? We’d love to welcome you!
Whether you’re a keen Christian or a sceptic trying to figure out the big questions of life, we want to give you the chance to develop spiritually – by learning from the Bible about who Jesus is, and what life with him is all about. We believe this happens best in the context of loving church community, where real friendships can be cultivated both with other students and with the wider church family! 

It looks like 2020/21 will be a strange year to be a student, and you may be approaching the new term with all sorts of worries and concerns – particularly if you’re a fresher. Well, we’re working hard to ensure all our students still get the opportunity to enjoy proper community – even in a time of face masks, social distancing and Zoom fatigue! Watch this video to learn more:

## Student link-up
Get to know other students by joining the churches student WhatsApp group. Meet with a City Church student and have the chance to find out more about us, and gain an easy way into church community. Text <a href="tel:07541171711">Rachael</a> to join the group.


## Wider church life
Although we have a specific programme for students, we are passionate about them being integrated into the wider church family. You can have opportunities to serve, come into church membership, and get to know other Christians outside the student bubble! All in all, our students are a core part of our church, and we want them to feel as much connection and ownership as anyone else in City Church!
