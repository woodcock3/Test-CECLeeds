City Students
WELCOME STUDENTS!
Each year we love welcoming students, new and old, into our church family. We’ve seen students from many
different backgrounds, countries and cultures find a home at City, and we would love to welcome you too!

SUNDAYS
Student Minibus – Don’t let our location put you off! We run a minibus service for our students who can’t
make it to church another way. We’re hoping to continue this this year with social distancing in place.
Student Lunches – We’re not sure how this will look this year, however, in a non-COVID world, following our
Sunday morning service our students head for lunch with another family in church to enjoy some good food
and fellowship.
Student Seminars – Student seminars happen a couple of times a term and are a great opportunity to chat
through what God’s Word has to say on a particular topic – past seminars have covered topics including
devotions, finances, relationships, rest and more.

PART OF THE FAMILY
At City, students are part of the church family.
Growth Groups – Mid-week we encourage our students to join a Growth Group near them (Usually the North
West and North East GGs) to be encouraged, challenged and supported by other members of the church
family as we study God’s Word together. Currently Growth Groups are running on Zoom, so they’re super easy
to access and get involved in.
Student, 20s &amp; 30s Weekend Away – At the end of January we have our annual weekend away. This is a great
chance not only to build great friendships with the other students at City, but also with the wider church
family.
Serving – From Crèche, Explorers, City Kids and Ignite, to Student Teas &amp; Coffees and the worship team, at City
we’ve been blessed with students serving in different church ministries and we’re always looking for more
people to get stuck in!
