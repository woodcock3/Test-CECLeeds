# WELCOME STUDENTS!
Each year we love welcoming students, new and old, into our church family. We’ve seen students from many
different backgrounds, countries and cultures find a home at City, and we would love to welcome you too!


# CONTACT US
Thinking of joining City this year? Get in touch! We’d love to welcome you, answer your questions, and give
you a bit of insight into what it’s like to be a student at City.
Just drop a line to the office email (see the ‘Contact Us’ page of our website) and we’ll get back in touch.
