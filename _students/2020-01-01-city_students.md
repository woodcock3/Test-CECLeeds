# In Leeds for university? We’d love to welcome you!

Whether you’re a keen Christian or a sceptic trying to figure out the big questions of life, we want to give you the chance to develop spiritually – by learning from the Bible about who Jesus is, and what life with him is all about. We believe this happens best in the context of loving church community, where real friendships can be cultivated both with other students and with the wider church family! 

It looks like 2020/21 will be a strange year to be a student, and you may be approaching the new term with all sorts of worries and concerns – particularly if you’re a fresher. Well, we’re working hard to ensure all our students still get the opportunity to enjoy proper community – even in a time of face masks, social distancing and Zoom fatigue!


Here are some welcome initiatives you can sign-up for now:

## Student link-up
Meet with a City Church student and have the chance to find out more about us, and gain an easy way into church community.

## Adopt-a-student
Don't want to be stuck in a student  bubble? Be 'adopted' by a couple/family in the church who can get to know you, and meet you for coffee from time to-time – as social distancing allows!

## Watch parties
If your unable to attend the church service physically, why not join other students and church family as they meet in small Zoom groups to watch the live stream together.
To sign-up for any of these, or just to say hello and register interest, click below:

You can also get in touch by sending us an email. Over the next few weeks we’ll be announcing further plans and events, so follow us on Instagram or Facebook to keep in the loop.

# Student life in church
Bible study

Every Sunday evening during term time we have our student Bible study - where we hang out with each other, and learn more about Jesus by digging into the Bible together. This runs on Zoom, with plenty of chance for chat and discussion in smaller groups.

We also have other fun events happening throughout the year including student lunches, weekends away, and Christmas/Summer parties!

# Wider church life

Although we have a specific programme for students, we are passionate about them being integrated into the wider church family. They're given opportunities to serve, come into church membership, and get to know other Christians outside the student bubble! All in all, our students are a core part of our church, and we want them to feel as much connection and ownership as anyone else in Grace Church!
