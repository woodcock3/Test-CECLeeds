## How we process your data

This website is powered by Jekyll, DeployHQ, Forestry.io and is hosted on GitHub. Forestry.io is only used as an external CMS. DeployHQ is used to deploy the website to the church's server. No traffic or visitor data ends up at Forestry.io or DeployHQ or their partners. GitHub, however, (like any hosting company) can have full insight in visitor data, like connecting IP addresses, visited pages, etc. Note that GitHub is not known to actively profile visitors.

### Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics. This happens only if you approve third party cookies and scripts. However, we have taken all actions we can to limit the power of Google. We have configured Google Analytics to anonymize IP addresses and use SSL at all times.
