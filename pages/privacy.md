## How we process your data

This website is powered by Jekyll, DeployHQ, Forestry.io and is hosted on GitHub. Forestry.io is only used as an external CMS. DeployHQ is used to deploy the website to the church's server. No traffic or visitor data ends up at Forestry.io or DeployHQ or their partners. GitHub, however, (like any hosting company) can have full insight in visitor data, like connecting IP addresses, visited pages, etc. Note that GitHub is not known to actively profile visitors.

### Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics. This happens only if you approve third party cookies and scripts. However, we have taken all actions we can to limit the power of Google. We have configured Google Analytics to anonymize IP addresses and use SSL at all times.

We use Google Analytics as a third party analytics service to collect information about how our website performs and how our users, in general, navigate through and use cecleeds.co.uk. This helps us evaluate how you use our website, compile statistical reports on activity, and improve our content and website performance.

You can control your Google Analytics cookie preferences through our cookie preference link located at the footer of our website. In addition, Google provides further information about its own privacy practices and offers a browser add-on to opt out of Google Analytics tracking.

### Other third party cookies

Certain pages on our website may set other third party cookies. For example, we may embed content, such as videos or forms, from another site that sets a cookie. While we try to minimize these third party cookies, we canâ€™t always control what cookies this third party content sets.
